git clone https://github.com/agustinlopez23/LearningDocker.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```



## Usage

You need to create two images in docker, one with the app that is in this repository, you do that through the Dockerfile execution that you find in the root folder of the project, and you must download the mongo image, and lift it in a container. When you have the two containers running, you can build with docker compose the application, which persists the data using mongo and docker without installing anything else.

1. Dockerfile

```sh
docker build -t <imagenametocreate>:<tag> .
```

2. Docker Compose

```sh
docker compose up
```
